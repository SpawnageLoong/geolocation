Quick Start
===========

This is a quick start guide to get you up and running with the
``geolocation`` package. Before continuing, make sure the package
has been installed correctly. See the :ref:`installation` section
for more information.

.. _Quick Start - Verify Install:

Verify Install
--------------

The package contains a launch file for demonstration purposes. Use
it to verify your installation:

.. code-block:: bash

    roslaunch geolocation demo.launch

The launch file will fake a GPS position in South Tuas, Singapore and
display the position in RViz using OpenStreetMaps. The fake GPS position
can be edited in ``/config/dummy_params.yaml``.

.. _Quick Start - Usage:

Usage
-----

To get started using ``geolocation`` in a live environment, run the
following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    roslaunch geolocation live.launch

This will launch the ``geolocation`` package with the default
configuration. The default configuration can be found in
``/config/ros_params.yaml`` and ``/config/topic_names.yaml``.

This launch command has one optional argument: ``dummy_gnss``.
Passing this argument as ``True`` will pass a static GNSS
coordinate to the program if a live GNSS coordinate cannot
be provided. 

.. code-block:: bash

    roslaunch geolocation live.launch dummy_gnss:="True"

The coordinates can be changes in ``/config/dummy_params.yaml``.
