Geolocation
===========
This is the documentation for the geolocation package, used in conjunction with the
`blahblah` package to detect and track unmanned aerial systems (UAS) using a sectorial
LiDAR sensor.

TL;DR: Run this command to start the full LiDAR system:

.. code-block:: bash

   start_lidar

Run this command to start the package with tunable parameters:

.. code-block:: bash

   roslaunch geolocation live.launch <PARAMS>
