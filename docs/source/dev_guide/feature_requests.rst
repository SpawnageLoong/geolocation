.. _Feature Requests:

Feature Requests
================
This page covers features that are lacking in the current version of the
software.  If you have a feature request, please add it to this page.

Currently, the page is separated into two sections: 1) features that are
handled by the package, and 2) features that are handled by external
packages (e.g. ``object3d_detector``)

Geolocation Feature Requests
----------------------------
These features may be added in future updates.


External Feature Requests
-------------------------
These features should be made as feature requests to the appropriate
maintainers/developers (i.e. Aruvii is the developer of ``object3d_detector``).
